# oem-aa-mod Installer

Installer package for [oem-aa-mod](https://github.com/VitaliyKurokhtin/oem-aa-mod) — adds Android Auto support to Mazda CMU (MZD Connect).

`run.sh` is an all-in-one script that handles both **installing** and **uninstalling** the mod. It will prompt you to choose when run.

Releases are built automatically whenever a new upstream version is published. Download the latest `oem-aa-mod-<version>-installer.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Bijan-A/oem-aa-mod-installer/releases) page.
